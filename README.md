### Hello, I am Ahmet ðŸ‘‹


 
 
  I am currently a Junior iOS Developer who is always eager to learn new technologies and develop solutions based on them. I try to learn new things about software, and try improve myself everyday. When I am not coding, you will find me traveling the world, biking, watching films, fishing, hiking.
